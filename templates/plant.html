    <h1>Manufacturing Plant Management</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Hydrogen Production</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Manage hydrogen production processes and safety.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Process Control Systems: Integrate with the plant's control systems to
          monitor hydrogen production processes, temperatures, pressures, and
          other variables.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remote Sensors: Utilize sensors to monitor equipment and
          infrastructure health, such as pumps, valves, and electrolyzers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gas Detection Systems: Implement gas sensors to monitor for leaks or
          other potential safety hazards related to hydrogen production.
        </li>
        <li>
          Energy Management System: Track energy consumption and production to
          optimize the plant's energy efficiency and reduce environmental
          impact.
        </li>
        <li>
          Equipment Health Monitoring: Employ predictive maintenance solutions
          to monitor the condition of critical equipment and preemptively
          address issues.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Data Integration and Visualization</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Log, visualize, and set alerts for plant conditions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Data Logging: Store historical data for analysis, compliance
          reporting, and future planning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Data Visualization: Create intuitive dashboards and visual
          representations of data for plant operators to monitor plant
          conditions and flood levels easily.
        </li>
        <li>
          Alarms and Alerts: Configure alarms and alerts for critical events,
          such as equipment failures, deviations from process parameters, or
          impending floods.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Environmental Monitoring</h2>
      <p class="description">Monitor environmental impact and water quality.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Emissions Tracking: Monitor and report on greenhouse gas emissions and
          other environmental parameters to meet regulatory requirements and
          reduce the plant's carbon footprint.
        </li>
        <li>
          Water Quality: Monitor water quality parameters to ensure that water
          used in the plant's processes meets environmental standards.
        </li>
